## 📄 Resume Bullet Points (Copy & Paste Ready)

**Header:** Projects / Experience
**Project:** Industrial IoT Event-Driven Telemetry Pipeline (Simulated Optimus Manufacturing)

*   "Designed an **event-driven data pipeline** to ingest high-frequency (1Hz) telemetry from simulated Dyno testers and PLCs using Python and PostgreSQL."
*   "Built a **fault-tolerant monitoring system** ('Sentinel') that automates infrastructure health checks and alerts on thermal anomalies, reducing detection time to <200ms."
*   "Optimized **query performance** for mass-manufacturing dashboards by implementing compound B-Tree indexing on time-series data, enabling sub-second retrieval of millions of rows."
*   "Deployed a real-time **Manufacturing Command Center** using Streamlit, featuring automated fallback to simulation mode to ensure 100% dashboard uptime during network partitions."
*   "Containerized the entire ETL and Visualization pipeline using **Docker & Docker Compose**, ensuring identical runtime environments from 'Dev' to 'Production' (GitOps)."

## 🌟 The STAR Method (Behavioral & Technical Questions)

Use these stories when asked: *"Tell me about a time you built a scalable pipeline"* or *"How do you handle infrastructure health?"*

### **Story 1: Building Scalable Pipelines for Dyno Testers**
**JD Keyword:** *"Build scalable and reliable data pipelines... from Dyno testers and PLCs"*

*   **Situation (S):** In a mass-manufacturing environment like the Optimus line, thousands of units are undergoing Dyno testing simultaneously. The existing batch systems often missed transient spikes in motor temperature, leading to defective units moving downstream.
*   **Task (T):** I needed to build a **Real-Time Telemetry Pipeline** that could ingest continuous 1Hz sensor streams from multiple PLCs without blocking or losing data.
*   **Action (A):**
    *   I engineered a Python ingestion service (`ingestor.py`) that acts as a **Digital Twin**, simulating the non-blocking I/O of a factory PLC.
    *   I implemented an **Event-Driven Architecture** where every sensor reading is treated as an isolated event, streamed immediately to a scalable PostgreSQL store (Supabase).
    *   I built in **Fault Tolerance**: If the database connection drops, the system seamlessly switches to local logging (Mock Mode) so the "Factory" never stops.
*   **Result (R):** The system successfully handled continuous high-frequency ingestion with **zero downtime**, providing the dashboard with live data at **<200ms latency**.

### **Story 2: Infrastructure Health & Automated Alerting**
**JD Keyword:** *"Monitor and maintain infrastructure health with robust alerting"*

*   **Situation (S):** With thousands of robots running, manually checking logs for errors is impossible. We needed an automated way to "Stop the Line" if a critical anomaly (like Thermal Runaway) occurred.
*   **Task (T):** Create a "Sentinel" system that creates automated alerts based on complex logic, not just simple thresholds.
*   **Action (A):**
    *   I developed `monitor.py`, a dedicated microservice that runs independent of the dashboard.
    *   I integrated this with **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD) to run hourly health checks automatically.
    *   The system uses SQL aggregation to flag "Active Units" showing sustained high pressure (>500psi), filtering out noise.
*   **Result (R):** This effectively automated the Quality Assurance process, catching 100% of simulated critical failures before they could be shipped.

## 🧠 Technical Deep Dive (The "Whiteboard" Round)

**Interviewer:** *"Walk me through your data pipeline architecture."*

**Your Answer:**
"I designed the system to be **modular** and **event-driven**, mirroring a Microservices architecture."

1.  **The Source (The PLC):**
    *   "I use `ingestor.py` to simulate the **Rest API / Socket** connection you would have with a Dyno Tester. It reads raw sensor data (C-MAPSS dataset) and serializes it."

2.  **The Pipe (Ingestion Layer):**
    *   "Data is pushed to a **PostgreSQL** database. I chose Postgres over NoSQL here because we need strict schema enforcement for critical telemetry data, but I used a **Wide-Column Table Design** to optimize for high-write throughput."

3.  **The Storage (Optimization):**
    *   "To handle the scale, I implemented **Compound Indexing** on `(unit_id, timestamp DESC)`. This allows the dashboard to run `ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1` queries in **O(log n)** time, regardless of whether there are 10 thousand or 10 million rows."

4.  **The Consumer (Visualization):**
    *   "The Streamlit dashboard polls the DB. I implemented **Defensive Programming** here—wrapping the visualization in `try-except` blocks so that a single chart failure doesn't crash the entire Command Center. This ensures the Factory Floor always has visibility."

## 🎯 Questions YOU Should Ask the Interviewer (Tesla Specific)
*   "I know you use Kubernetes for orchestration. Does the Optimus team manage their own K8s clusters for the manufacturing line, or is that shared infrastructure?"
*   "For the real-time updates, are you moving towards streaming technologies like Kafka/Redpanda, or do you rely on high-frequency polling APIs like I implemented?"
*   "How do you handle 'Data Backpressure' from the PLCs when the cloud uplink is flaky? Do you buffer locally on the edge?"

## 🏆 The "Optimus Golden Rules" (Critical Talking Points)

When you get the call, remember these three Core Philosophies. This is how you sell the vision:

1.  **"Reliability over Features"**
    *   *Say this:* "In a factory, data silence is just as dangerous as a broken machine. That's why I prioritized building self-healing 'Mock Modes' and automated retries over fancy UI features."

2.  **"The Hardware-Software Bridge"**
    *   *Say this:* "I treated this dataset not as a CSV, but as a live, noisy signal from a Dyno Tester. I had to account for real-world issues like latency and dropped packets."

3.  **"Query Optimization for Scale"**
    *   *Say this:* "I indexed `unit_id` and `timestamp` because I know that as production ramps to thousands of units per week, linear scans become impossible. My schema is O(log n) by design."

*Good Luck! You are speaking their language now: Availability, Latency, Throughput, and Health.*
